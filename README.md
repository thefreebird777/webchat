these will be editable soon


Things to learn and read up on:
===============================

* [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - the least bad java ide, much better than eclipse
* [Intellij ultamate free for students](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) - you will probably need the extra features for this project
* [Intellij shortcuts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/294167/what-are-the-most-useful-intellij-idea-keyboard-shortcuts) - they help a lot, especially learn ctrl-space
* [Google java style](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) - It is mandatory to follow this, everything but two space indents, four is what we will use. I will give you guys an somthing to autoformat your code, do it before uploading to this project.
* [Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.io/) - java server framework, very simple and easy to use
* [Git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) - this explains how github version control works, it will be necessary to know what and how to commit, branch, and pull code. This isn't much and fairly simple to learn. Intellij has easy to use functions that do this, so you don't need a terminal for this.

####That is all for now. I will set up a test server for you guys to branch and mess around with to learn dropwizard soon.
